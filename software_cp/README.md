# To Do For Machine Learning

### Data Labelling
- 11 folders including idle signal (approx 20 csv file each)
### Data preprocessing
- Low pass filter (continuous)
- Window segmentation
- Feature extractions
- Generate dataset.csv (w/ label)
### ML training
- Spilt data set into training / testing
- Using K nearest neighbour as ML model
- K fold
- Get score and confusion matrix
- Get model
### Use model to run prediction
- prediction on csv files
- prediction on real life data
